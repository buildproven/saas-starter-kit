- ⭕️ Add invitation + membership management endpoints (`/api/organizations/members`).
- ⭕️ Configure GitHub Actions to run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` on pull requests (quality.yml already exists; ensure it’s enabled).
- ⭕️ Define GitHub issue templates, labels, and project board (tracking this roadmap).

## Near-Term (Phase 1–2)

- ⭕️ Create `/admin` dashboard for SUPER_ADMIN operations (user/org search, plan overrides).
- ⭕️ Expand audit logging for key events (sign-in, API key creation, billing actions).
- ⭕️ Implement email verification flow (SendGrid integration, transactional templates).
- ⭕️ Add 2FA scaffolding (backup codes, OTP) for high-security tenants.
